# Notes on code

\item Two chunks of code have been removed from 'tables_and_maps'; one refers to a Table of the year of installation of each team and one refers to a table that contains a summary of INEP indicators. They both have been removed as they are not a part of the final version of the paper. The codes can be found in local version of 'TabelaseMapasSec3.R'.
